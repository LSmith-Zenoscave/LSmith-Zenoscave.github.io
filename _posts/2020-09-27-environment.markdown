Lately I've been struggling to find a good environment for python development. 
This is, at least partially, due to my high demands of such.
I'd like to put down a few common myths and speed-bumps I've found when working with code to see if I can remind myself,
or others, what is involved.

### A language, like any other code, is a tool
When we pick a tool to use in our lives, we often assess its fit for the job.
Why don't we often do the same with languages? with frameworks? with libraries? These are just tools as well.

You wouldn't use a pickax to sculpt David, nor a chisel to mine for gold. Both chop away parts of the medium, but in 
completely separate manners. Similarly in web apps there's a difference between "NginX" and a CGI/WSGI/ASGI server.
See what fits your needs and adjust appropriately.

### Good for you &ne; Good for all
If you are not limited in tool choice, you may find options available. Realize there's a double edged sword with
choosing the tool you are most familiar with. You may work better in it and be more comfortable with it's environments.
Yet, if working on a team, others probably have different sets of tools than you that they prefer. Find common ground.
That isn't to say all give up their favorite tool and use the one everyone hates. Find a tool that works for everyone at
least at an agreeable level. I guarantee there is at least one.

### Code comes first.
Although it is not so much a myth as a gotcha, I have found that the longer I delay the code process for planning and
curating my idea. The better prepared I am to execute it. Simple as that. Don't code first; you'll end up with crap.

### Code is permanent.
If you're in a greenfield project, you are in a great position! You have no one depending on the code-base.
As much as a sales team may want to sell it and hype it up to (potential) customers, there is less disappointment in a 
late product that does what's asked, than with one that's still late (although maybe slightly less) and does not. 
There's two things to glean from this. 1) software will be late. always. 2) Informed customers are happy customers.
With this in mind. the earlier you scrap a code base that obviously isn't up to par, the less disappointment there will
be in delay! Delete code often. I have 10 versions of a project before it sees the light of day. Don't wait too long,
though, as maybe someone else has similar ideas and could help or pass you up if you wait too long.
